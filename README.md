ADD_MEMBER_DATA() 
This function is used to add a new member's 
data to the member_data list. This function 
first checks if the email address and credit 
card number are valid, and then checks if 
the data for the new member is unique. If the 
data is valid and unique, the function adds 
the data to the member_data list and reloads 
the data into the record_table widget.

LOAD_MEMBER_DATA() 
This function is used to load the data for all 
members stored in the member_data list into a 
Treeview widget called record_table. This 
Treeview widget allows the user to view the 
data for each member in a tabular format. The 
function first clears any existing data in the 
record_table widget and then inserts each 
element from the member_data list as a new 
row in the record_table widget.

DELETE_MEMBER_DATA() 
This function is used to delete the data for an 
existing member from the member_data list. 
This function deletes the data for the 
member at the specified index in the 
member_data list, reloads the data for all 
members into the record_table widget, and 
clears the data in the entry widgets where 
the user can enter the data for a new 
member. This ensures that the member_data 
list and the record_table widget are updated 
and the entry widgets are ready for the user 
to enter data for a new member.

UPDATE_MEMBER_DATA() 
This function is used to update the data for an 
existing member in the member_data list. This 
function updates the data for the member at 
the specified index in the member_data list 
with the new data provided, and then calls the 
load_member_data() function to reload the 
data for all members into the record_table 
widget. This ensures that the updated data for 
the member is displayed in the record_table 
widget.

CLEAR_MEMBER_DATA() 
function is used to clear the data in the entry 
widgets where the user can enter the data for 
a new member, the search entry widget, and 
the record_table widget. This function uses 
the delete() method to clear the data in the 
entry and search widgets and then calls the 
load_member_data() function to reload the 
data for all members into the record_table 
widget. This ensures that the entry and 
search widgets are empty and the 
record_table widget is ready for the user to 
enter and view data for new members.

PUT_MEMBER_IN_ENTRY() 
This function is used to display the data for a 
selected member in the entry widgets where 
the user can enter the data for a new member. 
This function clears the data in the entry 
widgets, gets the data for the selected member 
from the member_data list, and inserts the data 
into the entry widgets. This allows the user to 
view and update the data for the selected
member.

ADD_MEMBER_DATA() 
 
THE ADD_MEMBER_DATA() FUNCTION IS USED TO ADD A NEW MEMBER'S DATA TO THE 
MEMBER_DATA LIST. THIS FUNCTION TAKES FOUR PARAMETERS: THE MEMBER ID, NAME, EMAIL 
ADDRESS, AND CREDIT CARD NUMBER.
FIRST, THE FUNCTION USES A REGULAR EXPRESSION PATTERN TO CHECK IF T HE EMAIL ADDRESS 
IS VALID. IF THE EMAIL ADDRESS IS NOT VALID, THE FUNCTION DISPLAYS AN ERROR MESSAGE

MEMBER_DATA LIST. IF IT DOES, THE FUNCTION DISPLAYS AN ERROR MESSAGE TO THE USER. IF 
THE DATA IS UNIQUE, THE FUNCTION ADDS THE DATA TO THE MEMBER_DATA LIST AND TH EN 
CALLS THE LOAD_MEMBER_DATA() FUNCTION TO RELOAD THE DATA INTO THE RECORD_TABLE 
WIDGET. THIS ENSURES THAT THE NEW MEMBER'S DATA IS DISPLAYED IN THE RECORD_TABLE 
WIDGET.

LOAD_MEMBER_DATA() 

THE LOAD_MEMBER_DATA() FUNCTION IS USED TO LOAD THE DATA FOR ALL MEMBERS STORED 
IN THE MEMBER_DATA LIST INTO A TREEVIEW WIDGET CALLED RECORD_TABLE. THIS TREEVIEW 
WIDGET ALLOWS THE USER TO VIEW THE DATA FOR EACH MEMBER IN A TABULAR FORMAT.
THE LOAD_MEMBER_DATA() FUNCTION FIRST LOOPS THROUGH ALL THE ITEMS IN THE 
RECORD_TABLE WIDGET AND DELETES THEM. THIS ENSURES THAT THE RECORD_TABLE WIDGET 
IS EMPTY BEFORE THE NEW MEMBER DATA IS ADDED TO IT.
NEXT, THE FUNCTION LOOPS THROUGH ALL THE ELEMENTS IN THE MEMBER_DATA LIST AND 
INSERTS EACH ELEMENT INTO THE RECORD_TABLE WIDGET AS A NEW ROW. THE PARENT, INDEX, 
TEXT, AND IID PARAMETERS OF THE INSERT() METHOD ARE USED TO SPECIFY THE PARENT ITEM, 
THE POSITION WHERE THE NEW ITEM SHOULD BE INSERTED, THE TEXT TO BE DISPLAYED, AND 
THE ITEM IDENTIFIER, RESPECTIVELY. THE VALUES PARAMETER IS USED TO SPECIFY THE VALUES 
TO BE DISPLAYED IN THE ROW. THIS ALLOWS THE DATA FOR EACH MEMBER TO BE DISPLAYED IN 
THE APPROPRIATE COLUMNS OF THE RECORD_TABLE WIDGET.

--------------------------------------------------------

DELETE_MEMBER_DATA() 
 
THE DELETE_MEMBER_DATA() FUNCTION IS USED TO DELETE THE DATA FOR AN EXISTING 
MEMBER FROM THE MEMBER_DATA LIST. THIS FUNCTION TAKES THE INDEX OF THE MEMBER IN 
THE MEMBER_DATA LIST AS A PARAMETER.
FIRST, THE FUNCTION USES THE DEL KEYWORD TO DELETE THE DATA FOR THE MEMBER AT THE 
SPECIFIED INDEX IN THE MEMBER_DATA LIST.
NEXT, THE FUNCTION CALLS THE LOAD_MEMBER_DATA() FUNCTION TO RELOAD THE DATA FOR 
ALL MEMBERS INTO THE RECORD_TABLE WIDGET. THIS ENSURES THAT THE DATA FOR THE 
DELETED MEMBER IS REMOVED FROM THE RECORD_TABLE WIDGET.
FINALLY, THE FUNCTION CALLS THE CLEAR_MEMBER_DATA() FUNCTION TO CLEAR THE DATA IN 
THE ENTRY WIDGETS WHERE THE USER CAN ENTER THE DATA FOR A NEW MEMBER. THIS 
ENSURES THAT THE ENTRY WIDGETS ARE EMPTY AND READY FOR THE USER TO ENTER DATA FOR 
A NEW MEMBER.

--------------------------------------------------------

MEMBER_DATA LIST.
FIRST, THE FUNCTION UPDATES THE DATA FOR THE MEMBER AT THE SPECIFIED INDEX IN THE 
MEMBER_DATA LIST WITH THE NEW DATA PROVIDED.

ALL MEMBERS INTO THE RECORD_TABLE WIDGET. THIS ENSURES THAT THE UPDATED DATA FOR 
THE MEMBER IS DISPLAYED IN THE RECORD_TABLE WIDGET.

PUT_MEMBER_IN_ENTRY() 

THE PUT_MEMBER_IN_ENTRY() FUNCTION IS USED TO DISPLAY THE DATA FOR A SELECTED 
MEMBER IN THE ENTRY WIDGETS WHERE THE USER CAN ENTER THE DATA FOR A NEW MEMBER. 
THIS FUNCTION TAKES THE INDEX OF THE SELECTED MEMBER IN THE MEMBER_DATA LIST AS A 
PARAMETER.
FIRST, THE FUNCTION CLEARS THE DATA IN THE ENTRY WIDGETS USING THE DELETE() METHOD.

MEMBER IS INSERTED INTO THEM.
NEXT, THE FUNCTION GETS THE DATA FOR THE SELECTED MEMBER FROM THE MEMBER_DATA 
LIST AND SAVES IT IN SEPARATE VARIABLES.
